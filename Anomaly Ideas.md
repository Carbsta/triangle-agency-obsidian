[[Anomalies]]

Carnivals - haunted house, trying to inflict fear.
Rides - the desire to fly
The carnival itself, a mysterious ticket booth - trapping people inside the carnival. Feelings of wonder. Feelings of being lost / getting separated from a loved one.
Mysterious ticket booth that gives people tokens that they can keep on spending, but it turn causes people to forget that they want to leave just as they think about wanting to leave.

Fossils. Learning. Uncovering pasts. Digging. Anomaly that gets people to uncover their past?  Or bury their past - forgetting, fossilising - turning people into fossils? Rapid aging? Turning people to dust?

Broadway cinema - projection. Focus: projecting onto others, or the feeling that others share your problems.
