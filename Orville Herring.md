He/They

Dream / Creature / R&D

Weregrebe - part of the [[werefowl]] community of Nottingham. He met a dream anomaly living in a pair of children's binoculars that had been left at [[Attenborough Nature Reserve]]. Inspired to make it in the big city, moved into Nottingham to try and live as a human.
Found the agency via a job listing on Monster.com.

Lives at [[33 The Friary, Lenton (Gregory Street)]]
#### Reality Trigger - Yes Right Now
Needs - need to eat bugs? Will build others with Peggy.
3 [[Chaos]]: have an urge bubble to the surface.
If you *ignore* this urge - the willpower spent ignoring it causes you to struggle to communicate with others. The Relationship that most believes your disguise loses one Connection.

If weregrebe truth confessed or exposed to someone, mark a box on the "Revealed" track.
When this happens when all boxes are marked, or you are exposed publicly in a way that can't be undone, your disguise no longer functions.
