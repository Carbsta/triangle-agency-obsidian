Impromptu, location only determined today - now at [[33 Chilwell Road, Beeston - SORA Cafe]].

Main attraction is the trendy ice-cream.

Crowd is not too large - couple dozen.

**How do the agents fit in?** Folks here are dressed for the heat, swimwear, plunging into the pool etc.

Possible scenes:
- Talking to folks lounging.
- Lots of folks complain loudly about the heat, and it only gets hotter into the afternoon.
- Some might have heard about the [[Mysterious Ice Cream Truck]] before.
- opportunity for party goers to talk about the truck's history ![[Mysterious Ice Cream Truck#History]]
- A particularly laid back and chill guy has probably tried it before - he hasn't triggered the [[Ice Cream Anomaly]]'s ability yet. But he's come back for more.
- Folks might gossip that they've never seen the guy inside but speculate about the hand that serves.
- Someone saw someone get let into the truck - they haven't seen them come out yet though???

People will be ordering and enjoying ice-cream throughout the party.
**Point out to the agents that folks are ordering from this truck**

#### After the agents have settled into the party - **start freezing people**
tell tale situations of heat:
- sunbathers
- someone running by the pool
- the guy wearing too many layers
- those folks who were complaining loudly earlier
Frozen people have **smiles on their faces** - relief!
Frozen people will turn witnesses in [[Loose Ends]].
