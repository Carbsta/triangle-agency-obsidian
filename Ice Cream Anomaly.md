A humanoid form made of constantly swirling, half melted ice cream.

#### Special Rule:
After eating or using a treat:
If at any point your pulse or body temperature rises significantly:
you begin to freeze.
Feels like a huge relief at first, then it kills you!
(**2 Harm**)

Could be triggered if agents are running or sweating.
![[ice-cream pool party#After the agents have settled into the party - **start freezing people**]]

#### Focus:
**Relief from the Heat**
Feeding off the moment right when the freezing starts.
Anomaly doesn't understand that it doesn't have to fully freeze people to get it.

#### Impulse
Offering people ice-cream or treats as a relief from the heat, and freezing them later - right when they would get the most relief.

#### Domain:
The inside of the [[Mysterious Ice Cream Truck]].
Cold, freezing interior.
Can use powers or trick the anomaly to be let in. E.g complaining loudly about the heat, but refusing treats.

#### Encounter:
Inside the truck the anomaly will try to kill the agents - wants to keep doing what its doing.
Will try to embrace the agents - any touch will immediately do **2 harm** - the target begins to freeze.

#### Eliminate:
Ripple Gun

#### Capture:
- Lure it out of the van - it will melt into something harmless that can be shoved in the briefcase.
- Help satiate everyone in the party in a more normal way - satiate and calm it.

#### Escape:
- All the agents are frozen
- Truck drives away and they lose it
