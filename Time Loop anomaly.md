#anomaly 

Ideas, bubble somewhere in Nottingham that is caught in a timeloop - entering the area traps you in the time loop but you keep your awareness that you are in a timeloop thanks to your external memories. People already in the area are not aware that they are in a time loop and lose their memory.
Something happens at the end of the timeloop to wipe out everyone inside the bubble, and reset the time loop. The agency isn't able to bring people back to the breakroom
