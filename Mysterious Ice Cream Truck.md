Contains the domain of the [[Ice Cream Anomaly]] inside.

Truck is pastel blue, with a big vinyl sticker of an ice-cream cone on one side of the truck with no brand name.
The other side of the truck is covered in pictures of what they offer. Although it doesn't have known flavours or characters - everything is a little off.
As you look at it it changes to show exactly what you want: not just ice-cream.
Anything that would bring relief from the heat. E.g: cool drinks, an ice-pack, a tank top.
**Ask the players what they see.**

If someone orders a slot opens and a hand so cold that it gives off its own fog hands them the item.

The doors are locked, and impervious to physical damage.

No windows, apart from the windscreen - entirely covered by ice cream smeared across the inside of the glass.

**Can use powers or trick the anomaly to get in.**
Complain loudly about being hot, but refuse treats - anomaly will open the door to let them in.

**Being too obvious about their intentions to capture the anomaly will cause the truck to speed away to escape!**

#### History
The truck has been around for a few months.
Always pops up on unseasonably hot days. (Like this one)
People assume the owner must have an odd sense of humour.
- Its been spotted around house fires, tacky!
- But the treats are so good no one's really complained.
