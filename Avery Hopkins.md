[[Field Team 3]] General Manager

Business Formal Suspenders, glasses, beard, red tie.

Often looks tired, with piles of papers overflowing their desk. Drowning in the paperwork of being a Field Team General Manager. Broadly optimistic, will gently but firmly remind Agents of rules, policy and fair (but strict) with commendations and demerits.
