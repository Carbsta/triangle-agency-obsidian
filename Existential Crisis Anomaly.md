#anomaly

### Focus
Existential Dread - the feeling of inevitable death, deja vu.
### Impulse
Be witnessed.
### History
An ancient and powerful anomaly, from humanities first feelings on insignificance staring up into the endless stars - until one of those stars fell to earth. Generates huge amounts of resonance from being witnessed by a single person, due to the intensity of the feelings it inflicts on people. It first consumed a hopeless person who looked into the reflection of a moonlit pool and upon seeing themselves saw something impossible. Often manifested by artists looking to capture something essential to human experience who feel themselves overwhelmed or consumed by their place in the universe. A whole school of artists succumbed to the effect of the anomaly in renaissance Venice, one of them realised what was happening and managed to trap the anomaly in a box of mirrors.

### Domain
An old mahogany box lined with silver mirrors that trapped the anomaly - simply holding the box would cause unnatural feelings of dread of what might be inside.

### Appearance
Incomprehensible - viewing directly triggers the anomalies special rule - dealing 10 harm.
If seen indirectly, looks like an impossibly bright point of light being reflected infinitely - often causing lasting after images in observers.

like staring into the sun unable to look away
Each of your atoms blown off from you by the searing solar wind
Each of your atoms is becoming ts own conscious self, suddenly you are experiencing 7 billion billion billion lives at once, each distinct yet familiar to your life so far going through living a whole independent life that all ends the same way - finding themselves looking directly at this anomaly. And each of those selves continues this experience recursively. 
The Agency is saving one of those "selves" from that endless diverging death by returning them to the break room - after what feels like a concerning number of loops.


Chaos effects
- creating feelings of dread, insignificance
- incredibly bright lights
- duplicating people, infinite reflections, fractals
