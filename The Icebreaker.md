#mission #the-icebreaker

An [[Ice Cream Anomaly]] feeding off the feeling of relief from the heat it gives people, right before they freeze to death, inhabiting a [[Mysterious Ice Cream Truck]] that's going to be a hip cool [[ice-cream pool party]] at [[33 Chilwell Road, Beeston - SORA Cafe]]. 

## Morning Meetings

[[Kelb Cambrian]] - you are brought in for a meeting with an upset subsidiary - FroGlo. Some suit from FroGlo, Darren is yelling at you. Apparently some new ice cream truck is getting buzz around the city, and their deal with the Agency involves keeping frozen yoghurt as Nottingham's #1 treat of choice - so your department needs to help.
Take Kelb's ideas for a plan relevant to their Competency as a Barista.

[[Kaeleigh "K"]] - you are invited to a pop-up event planned in the city. Cool impromptu thing, doesn't even have a location yet. [[Kirsty]] is going, and links you the social media fan account of a mysterious ice cream truck reportedly serving the best stuff in town. The location is dropping later today. Do you accept the invite?

[[Orville Herring]] - You see a car swerving out of their lane on your way into work.
Do you use your powers to stop it? Either way, when thing settle down you catch a glimpse of why: the driver has frozen solid and is encased in a thin layer of ice. They are dead.

[[Destiny Summer]] - You are working at the ice-cream store with your Boss, its a blazingly hot day for April, unseasonably warm. And business is booming. Sweaty business men come stop by with their ties loosened, shoppers are stopping for refreshment and something to cool down.
Prompt for Boss: Destiny forgot to do something important for you last week, tell her what it is.

## Mission Briefing
You all arrive at the [[Nottingham Branch]], a large triangular plaza with tastefully planted trees and less tastefully anti-homeless benches dot around an abstract bronze fountain of a globe teetering on the top of a tetrahedron. A sleek glass and concrete office building, a triangular prism with striking red accents.

I'm here! [[Avery Hopkins]] Pull up the slideshow.
People are freezing in the streets.
The only lead we have put together is a recent rise in social media posts about a mysterious unbranded ice cream truck that people are head over heels for.

We have mapped out known freezes with known truck locations, and the patterns match.
The general populace hasn't noticed yet though and its not everybody who tries it.

**Beep!** [[Kaeleigh "K"]] gets a text. If she denied the invitation there is a passive aggressive note. Ice Cream truck: spotted. The [[ice-cream pool party]] has started. Kirsty is in danger. Location - [[33 Chilwell Road, Beeston - SORA Cafe]]
I should remind [[Kelb Cambrian]] that capturing this Anomaly will get that froyo guy Darren off his back. Its personal.
