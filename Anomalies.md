#anomaly 

Ripples - almost every coherent thought made by a sentient mind. So there must be trillions of them, everywhere (in the Lobby - Parallel to Reality). Just like thoughts, they are infinitely variable and encompass the entirety of experience! The "Lobby" embraces all of reality, reacting dynamically and immediately to everything that occurs! (Could be considered beautiful!)

"Anomalies" is huge umbrella. Agency considers all the agents anomalies, but also doesn't want anomalies to exist!

Ripples combine based on similar thoughts - implies that anomalies don't have to be single strong thoughts but can be combined from a whole strong subset or theme or connected thoughts. Can make a "thought cloud" for an anomaly of sample ripples that could be contributed to it. Unsure if there is hierarchy or collaboration - The Agency implies its hierarchy but that's the *agency*.

The focus fuels the anomaly because human's thinking about related thoughts would create more ripples -> feeding energy directly to the anomaly.

**Focus - *feeling*  towards a *subject***
Quality of the *feeling* can help create the *Impulse.*
Location of the *subject* often is the location of the *Domain*

Anomalies sustain resonant with this energy as the resonant uses their powers - can describe players feeling less hungry as their powers grow? Player's powers and effects should be related to those anomalies focus - creating the desired thoughts in subjects / onlookers of the powers. Feeding on loose ends! I should portray player's anomalies as being satiated by them creating loose ends / people observing its focus.

Domains should be where these observations are the strongest / have sustained fuelling the anomaly for a long enough time to suffuse objects/the location -  where the anomaly "haunts"

Anomalies Impulse - creating scenarios that lead to observation of the focus and people thinking about the focus. Can be fun to play with positive focuses that create conflicts of interest.

Give the anomalies desires, attachments, obsessions, emotions - make them feel "human" to the players!

Hollows - the anomaly without access to the necessary thoughts to sustain it: anomaly's focus is removed, destroyed or forgotten. Death Spiral.

Hollows are good anomalies for forming resonants - seeking a new source of stability. Naturally hosts and anomalies would converge - the hosts changing alongside the anomaly. Agency intervenes keeping agents "stable."

"Sentient minds are always by necessity thinking of themselves" - Agency! The Agency is ultimately self serving, thinking of itself - that's what makes it stable? Wouldn't this create ripples and anomalies related to the agency, doing a good job etc? Do optional objectives giving commendations and demerits fuel the Agency/Urgency's power?
