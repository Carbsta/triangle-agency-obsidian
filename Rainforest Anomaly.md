## Focus
Humanity's desire to return to a time-- or self-- they have irrevocably lost.
## Domain
A rainforest sprouting in the sewer system below Nottingham City - a recreation of the Anomaly's very first birthplace, before a band of 16th century explorers burnt it to the ground.

## Appearance
Passionfruit vine, vines. A portion wrapped around a trellis inside a glass cage at FOUNT.
It grows round glossy fruits, broad purple flowers, and occasionally eyes, tearful and unblinking.

## Impulse
To recreate its long lost home. Will grow in the sewers, stretch to the city's water supply, get its tendrils in all of Nottingham's population. When it has gathered enough strength it will bend their bodies to breaking point, tearing people apart in an explosive display of flowers and vines - transforming Nottingham.

## History
Hundreds of years old, in various forms, feeding on humanity's desire to halt the march of time. Born in early 1500s - Juan Ponce de Leon's searches for the fountain of youth in the jungles of Florida. The explorer's found an anomaly with those powers but had no idea and burnt it and the forest down to build a settlement. Anomaly kept alive by humanity continuing to yearn for times lost.
The advent of social media and fear of aging caused it to flourish again, growing up through cracks in the pavement where the forest once stood.
