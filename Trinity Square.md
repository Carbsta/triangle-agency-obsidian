Trinity Square is packed with salons, restaurants and entertainment venues.
Amid all the hubbub, its clear that something isn't quite right.

People are engaged in unusually loud, intense conversations under the green and gold overhang of [[Tryptik Caf√©]]'s patio. Three people there are obviously crying.

There is a woman crouched on the ground, staring into a puddle in the middle of the street.

Meanwhile, a small crowd is gathering outside of [[FOUNT]]. A Luxury medispa across the street from Tryptik. A man and woman are arguing in the doorway.

### Maya and the Puddle
Maya Ng (Eng) (She/Her) is crouching on the street - examining her reflection in a puddle. She's poking at her cheeks and neck. She's wearing a professional beige suit with her hair pinned back.

When the agents first notice / approach her, she vanishes into the puddle.
**Imprisoning Minor Anomaly**

The puddle starts flowing towards a small crowd that has formed outside of FOUNT.
If the agents don't stop it it will take more people - resulting in **15 Loose Ends**

If the agents can save Maya;
- Her face is oddly familiar
- She began using Aquifer products right after launch a few weeks ago
- She's come back to try and return the products she purchased - although she saw great results, one of her friends doesn't quite look like herself anymore which she didn't take well.
- While imprisoned, she's in a rainforest teeming with life. She is glad to be set free but kind of misses the rainforest, she felt free there too.
