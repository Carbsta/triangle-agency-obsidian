Notes for running my games in the [Nottingham Branch]() of the Triangle Agency.

I will record information about the [[Field Agents]], [[Anomalies]], [[Relationships]], [[Loose Ends]] and [[Factions]] of the Nottingham region. These will be packaged up into [[Missions]], with notes for planned future missions and notes for what actually happened on the missions we play.

Also I'll try to jot down any [[Weird Stuff in Nottingham]] that I encounter to potentially turn into the above categories of content and as inspiration. Notes will contain a geolocation to place them within [[Nottingham]].

I'll record any campaign [[Timelines]] or [[Tracks]] as required.
