Situated not far from Unity Square, the HMRC offices and the Victorian red brick Nottingham Station.

Sleek glass and concrete triangular office building with red accent features. Triangular plaza with border of trees and uncomfortable metal benches. A bronze fountain of a globe balancing on the tip of a tetrahedron.

Tram line runs in the shadow of the rear face of the office building to the south, but tram goers arenâ€™t privy to what goes on behind those tinted windows.
