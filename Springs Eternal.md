### Mission Briefing
We've picked up unusual patterns of behaviour which seem to be concentrated around Trinity Square in the city centre:
Increased rates of spontaneous crying.
Constant unexpected reunions with old friends.
We also have security camera footage showing many different people with uncannily similar appearances, to name a few.
We'd recommend starting your investigations there.

The Agency is reminded of an Anomalous incident from the 1500s - but our models have determined only a 0.02% likelihood that it is related to the current situation. **It Should Be Ingored By Each Agent**
You should acknowledge ignorance now.

If anyone refuses to acknowledge ingnorance: +1 Demerit
Given a heavily redacted report from Agent Luella McConnel in the early 1900s.
She describes following a trail of reports of similar but unexplained emotional and physical effects amongst explorers in what would later become southern Florida in the early 1500s, Jaun Ponce De Leon and co. But she couldn't find any evidence of the anomaly's existence in the intervening centuries. She tried to lure it out by creating a tourist attraction in Florida related to her best guess towards its Focus - but with no luck.

### Optional Objectives
+1 Commendation if you wear a flower crown (once per Agent)
+3 Commendations if you conduct an experiment
+6 Commendations for the first agent to win a lawsuit
