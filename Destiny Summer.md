Catalogue / Persued / Clown

Ex-etsy witch, used catalogue powers to produce items as part of the coven. Culty over-dependence on her, she escaped the Coven, leaving one day unannounced. They are looking for her.

#### Reality Trigger: On Your Trail
3: Chaos - highlight a person who recognises you and will report back to those looking for you. If you do not take time to put them off your scent they will go rooting around in your private life; the Relationship who knows the least about you loses on Connection and will ask some difficult questions during your next scene with them.

If you reveal your new identity or location to people who would recognise you, mark the next box on the "Caught" track. When this happens while all boxes are marked your past catches up to you.
