#springs-eternal #fount 

Stepping into FOUNT is like entering a stock photo.
The space is flooded with light, which dances over soft white curtains and the broad leaves of potted plants.
Gentle ambient music and sound scaping filters in from unseen speakers.


### Shop
The first room you step into is this expansive shop and showroom, carrying an expansive yet curated array of scrubs, creams, lotions and cleansers along with a selection of scented candles and bath oils.
The smells are pungent, yet gentle and clean. Notes of aloe, cotton, passionfruit.

The new Aquifer set is displayed like fine art in a glass case at the centre of the room, blue-green frosted glass bottles glistening like jewels.
Trial bottles of the line rest on a round table around the case.

Sampling aquifer - The agent is flooded with emotion, roll d4:
1. The agent must share a memory they tried to repress
2. The agent must confess something to one of their Relationships
3. the agent sees fire, smoke, darkness and then the face of Serena Evermore (Beautiful face, slender, high cheekbones, narrow brows)

At the back of the storefront is the reception area.

### Reception

The receptionist sad behind a half circle desk holding a tablet. She is sitting like a tranquil enigma, her unisex jumpsuit tailored just so. Her face is oddly familar.
