International medispa and cosmetics brand, with head quarters and primary storefront here in Nottingham.

# Exterior
Impossibly clean, tall windows disappear into an undulating concrete facade, polished to whiter-than-white, which merges into a swooping overhang that meets the ground like a wave. Beneath it, a chaotic scene unfolds.

A crowd has gathered to catch a glimpse of [[Jay Hsieh]] who is visiting to promote FOUNT's new product line, although he's not here right now.

Two people are arguing loudly in front of the doorway, and there is a man lingering awkwardly near them, trying to figure out a way around.

Through the crowd you can just make out some gauzy white curtains, plants and a row of gleaming blue-green bottles inside.

### Blocking the Doorway
[[Indigo Jones]] (she/her) is arguing loudly with [[Quinn Wilmar]] (He/Him)

She is insisting that as a "Very Popular Content Creator" she should be getting free services or discounts like [[Jay Hsieh]] does.

Quinn doesn't have time for this, and is trying to get Indigo out of the store. He's the head of FOUNT marketing and brand outreach.

From listening and speaking to Indigo:
- She was finally able to snag an appointment at FOUNT, but they asked her to leave when she was caught filming content in the mineral pools.
- She's convinced that they are trying to push her out of the industry.
- She doesn't know it, but her video contains evidence of the anomaly - a thin vine snaking out from one of the pool's drains.

### Undercover Investigator
There is a conspicuously out-of-place man here, in business formal.
[[Gregory Doppler]] (he/him) is an undercover OPSS (Office for Product Safety and Standards) investigator.
He's made an appointment under the fake name *Jeffrey Fizeau*

He looks like he's nervously looking for a way around this crowd to sneak into the building, and is sweating profusely.

*If the Agents don't help Gregory* he will clumsily put FOUNT's staff on high-alert - suspecting corporate espionage from a competing brand, making them more hostile to the agents.

If they can get Gregory to admit to his real purpose:
- He was tipped off to the potential inclusion of unsavoury ingredients in Aquifer products.
- His Contact is [[Poppy Ingler]] (She/Her) - an aesthetician at FOUNT.
- He is here to gather evidence.
