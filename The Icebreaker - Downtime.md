[[Kaeleigh Merel]] Probation - short scene receiving her punishment and the red flag of disrepute - Ask what menial tasks she does as part of her probation, and have a short bit of interaction with her [[Whisper]]. Whisper tunes in about the boring probation work, and starts messing with what other people are saying.

Prompt players if they would like to spend any commendations on requisitions, or if they have already.

[[Kelb Cambrian]] scene with [[Chivonne Inpu]] - increasing connection for the first time. She's doing a book singing for her new self-hustle book "Better Work B\*itch". Somewhat dismissive of Kelb, but does get a moment to talk with him and asks about his new job.

[[Destiny Summer]] spending time with [[Ice Cream Shop Boss - Randal Ballad]] - increasing connection for the first time. What does Randal want to congratulate Destiny about?

[[Orville Herring]] spending time with their [[Dream]] - dream sequence, Orville flying with a dark shape with many eyes, teeth and wings.
[[Kelb Cambrian]] spending time with their [[Drain]] - Sat at a cocktail bar, alone, people come and go talking loudly, getting drinks - music booms. People here are hungry, and that feeds something at the back of your mind.
