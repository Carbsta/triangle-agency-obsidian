## Focus
Humanity's desire to return to a time-- or self-- they have irrevocably lost.
## Domain
A rainforest sprouting in the sewer system below Nottingham City - a recreation of the Anomaly's very first birthplace, before a band of 16th century explorers burnt it to the ground.

## Appearance
Passionfruit vine, vines. A portion wrapped around a trellis inside a glass cage at FOUNT.
It grows round glossy fruits, broad purple flowers, and occasionally eyes, tearful and unblinking.
Extends into the sewer below - huge sprawling passionfruit vine.

## Impulse
To recreate its long lost home. Will grow in the sewers, stretch to the city's water supply, get its tendrils in all of Nottingham's population. When it has gathered enough strength it will bend their bodies to breaking point, tearing people apart in an explosive display of flowers and vines - transforming Nottingham into its long-lost home.

## History
Hundreds of years old, in various forms, feeding on humanity's desire to halt the march of time. Born in early 1500s - Juan Ponce de Leon's searches for the fountain of youth in the jungles of Florida. The explorer's found an anomaly with those powers but had no idea and burnt it and the forest down to build a settlement. Anomaly kept alive by humanity continuing to yearn for times lost.
The advent of social media and fear of aging caused it to flourish again, growing up through cracks in the pavement where the forest once stood.

[[Olive Huyhn]] (who-wyn) caught wind of the discovery of this strange plant, and managed to lay claim to it and get [[Serena Evermore]] to colllect it from a vine-choked parking lot.

Serena knew this was no ordinary plant. Once a curious tendril ensnared her finger they bonded in that moment, understanding each other. She felt its sadness, its longing for its ancestral home and shared in it. She was also looking for her roots. The Anomaly felt like it knew her, but couldn't remember why.

The anomaly trusted Serena - trusting that she could help it remember its past. It willingly came to [[FOUNT - medispa]]. The product development team built it a special enclosure to thrive in.
Over the years they have developed sustainable ways to distil its sap, fruits and leaves into potent products - powerful rejuvenating properties. But they have made no progress in finding it a new home.

Serena has not kept her promise. Its restless. Its waited years - and is ready to take action.
